# Portfolio Site

This portfolio is created using **React** and **Sanity CMS**. React serves as a dynamic front-end, and retrieves content to display from Sanity.

## The Goal

I'm creating this portfolio (and documenting my journey) in order to learn new concepts and tools quickly, as well as to create a place to share the things I'm working on and learning moving forward. 

I *really* like Data Science and related things, but I believe Data Science does not exist in a vacuum. Rather, it is a field with approaches and tools that can augment or enhance other capabilities. Learning how to develop and deploy software fits into the larger capability of being able to tell a story using data.

## User Stories

 * The portfolio site runs on my Digital Ocean droplet and is publicly accessible at port 80 or 443
 * The portfolio site automatically pulls from my Github to display project information
 * The portfolio site is deployed using one or more **Docker** containers
 * The portfolio site is navigable using a modern routing strategy
 (*i.e. http://site/projects/project-name*)
 * I can bring up/down/restart all of the required pages at once
 * I can build and add new site pages in an automated fashion
 (*i.e. with a **Jenkins** CI server or similar tool*)

 ## Credits

 I'm using various sources of knowledge to rapidly learn and implement concepts. I will note significant resources here.
